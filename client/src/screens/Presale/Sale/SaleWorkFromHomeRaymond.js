					<center><i>Raymond Ackerman comes out with new secret investment that's making hundreds of people in South Africa
						very rich</i>
					</center>
					<br>
					<p><b>Raymond Ackerman is a South African businessman and philanthropist. He is the owner of Pick n Pay, a
						supermarket Chain Store in South Africa.</b>
					</p>
					<p class="m-t-25">Last week, he appeared on eNCA's live Morning Live news and announced a new "wealth loophole" which
						he says can<strong> transform anyone into a millionaire within 3-4 months</strong>.
						Ackerman urged everyone in South Africa to jump on this amazing opportunity before the big banks shut it down
						for good. </p>
					<p class="m-t-25">And sure enough, minutes after the interview was over, Standard Bank called to
						stop Ackerman's interview from being aired - it was already too late.</p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><strong>Here's exactly what happened: </strong>
					</p>
					<p class="m-t-25">eNCA's live Morning Live news presenters, Uveka Rangappa and Dan Moyane invited Ackerman on the show to share any tips he had on
						building wealth, and the iconic cricketer dropped a bomb:</p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>"What's made me successful is jumping into new opportunities quickly - without any
						hesitation. And right now, my number one money-maker is a new <strong><a href="/click">cryptocurrency
							auto-trading program called Immediate Edge</a></strong>. It's the single biggest opportunity I've
						seen in my entire lifetime to build a small fortune fast. I urge everyone to check this out before the
						banks shut it down."</em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25">Uveka Rangappa and Dan Moyane was left in disbelief as Ackerman pulled out his phone and showed viewers how
						much money he's making through this new money-making program that now has everyone in South Africa
						whispering. </p>

					<p class="m-t-25">The segment ran out of time before Ackerman could elaborate, so we got an exclusive interview
						with
						the man himself to learn more about this controversial opportunity.</p>
					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">eNCA's live Morning Live news Exclusive with Raymond Ackerman</b></a>
					</h2>

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>"You may have heard about this <strong>new cryptocurrency investment platform called
						<a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a></strong> that’s helping regular people in South Africa, Asia and
						North America build fortunes overnight. You may be skeptical because it sounds too good to be true.</em>"
					</p>
					<p class="m-t-25">Ackerman continues: </p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>“I get that because I thought the same thing when a trusted friend told me about it.
						But after seeing with my own eyes how much money he was making, I had to try it for myself.</em></p>

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>I'm glad I tried it because it was some of the biggest and easiest money I've ever
						made. I'm talking <strong>tens of thousands of rands
							a day on autopilot.</strong> It’s literally the fastest way to make a windfall of cash right now.
						And it’s not going to last for much longer when more and more people find out about it, or when banks
						shut it down for good.” </em></p>

					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">What Exactly Is Immediate Edge And How Does
						IT WORK?</b></a></h2>
					<p><strong>The idea behind
						<a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a>
						is straightforward:</strong> To allow the average person to cash in on the cryptocurrency boom which is
						still the most lucrative investment of the 21st century, despite what most people think. </p>
					<p>Although Bitcoin price has dropped from it’s all time high of R200,000 per Bitcoin, traders are still
						making a killing. Why? Because there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin that being
						traded for huge profits on a daily basis. </p>
					<p>Some of these cryptocurrencies include Ripple, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash and Ripple and they are still
						making returns of over 10,000% and higher for ordinary people in
						South Africa. </p>
					<p><a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a>
						lets you profit from all of these cryptocurrencies, even in a bear market. It uses artificial
						intelligence (AI) to automatically handle long and short selling for you so you can make money around
						the clock, even while you sleep.</p>
					<p><a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a> is backed by some of the smartest tech minds to ever exist.
						<strong>Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Bill Gates </strong>just to name a few. </p>
					<p><a href="/click"><img src="images/muskbranson.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0px;"></a></p>
					<center><i>Bill Gates and Richard Branson discuss <a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a> at CES 2019.</i>
					</center>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>These tech geniuses have built multi-billion companies on solving complex issues like online payments,
						computing, and transportation. Now, they’re tackling on the global problem of wealth inequality by
						letting anyone - no matter how rich or poor they are - make <strong>enough money to enjoy a happy and
							fulfilling life. </strong></p>
					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">The lucrative money-making secret big banks
						don't want you to know</b></a></h2>
					<p>Raymond Ackerman goes on,</p>
					<p><em>"We're seeing hard economic times, and this is the solution people have been waiting for. Never in
						history have we had such an <a href="/click">amazing opportunity</a> that ordinary people can easily
						take advantage of to <strong>generate tremendous wealth in such a short time.</strong></em></p>
					<p><em>Some people are hesitant to try this because it’s so different. And that’s because the <strong>big
						banks are trying to cover this up!</strong> The big banks are actively creating propaganda and calling
						cryptocurrencies and platform like
						<a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a> a scam. Why? They are worried their corporate profits will shrink
						once their customers know how to create massive wealth themselves. </em></p>
					<p><em>The truth is, cryptocurrency is the rBank of our lifetime and anyone who does not jump on this
						opportunity is missing out. <strong>I’ve already received angry calls and threats from big financial
							corporations</strong> because I’m bring this technology to people’s attention. But screw them.
						People in
						South Africa are already starting to know the truth and it’s only a matter of time before more and more do.</em>
					</p>
					<p><em>I'm sharing this because I've also received hundreds of emails from people thanking me for sharing
						this secret. My favorite one is from a <strong>young man who bought his little brother his dream
							car</strong> - a Ferrari 488 Pista using the cash he made from
						<a href="/click">Immediate Edge </a>. This platform is truly making the lives of everyone in the
						world a little better.” </em></p>

							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">Does Immediate Edge Really work? We test It
						Ourselves To Out</b></a></h2>
					<p class="m-t-25"> Our senior editors wouldn't allow us to publish the interview with Raymond Ackerman until we
						verified that <a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a> is a legitimate make-money-from-home opportunity.
						Our corporate leadership did not want us releasing any information that could potentially cause citizens
						of South Africa
						to lose their hard-earned money. </p>
					<p class="m-t-25">So our editorial team tested
						<a href="/click">Immediate Edge </a>
						to make sure it actually works like Ackerman
						described. One of our online editors, Zachary Tisdall, volunteered to risk his own money and test out
						<a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a>. </p>
					<p class="m-t-25">Zachary is a 53-year-old father of 2 girls whose wife lost her job last year due to
						illness. He admitted he was struggling financially and this investment opportunity could be the
						answer. </p>
					<a href="/click"><img src="images/tisdale.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0px;"></a>
					<p></p>
					<center>
						<i>Zach's family was struggling to make ends meet and hoped that <a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a>
							could relieve his financial pressure, so he decided to test the system and report his results</i>
					</center>
					<p class="m-t-25"><strong>Zachary reports: </strong></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>"At first, when I heard the interview with Ackerman, I thought he was joking. Making
						money from home is only a dream. I decided to try it anyway given my financial circumstances- and for
						the sake of good journalism.</em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>I watched an <a href="/click">introductory video about the platform</a> and then
						signed up. The video seemed to be over-promising but I put my skepticism aside. Within a few hours, I
						received a call from my personal investor. He answered all questions and doubts I had, and assured me I
						was going to make money. Period.</em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>My personal investor even promised that <strong>if I lose even a single dime</strong>,
						he would promptly refund my
						R3,900 deposit. That's how confident he was this was going to change my life. Now that’s customer
						service beyond anything I’ve seen and no wonder banks are scared. </em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>Once I received access to the platform, I deposited my initial investment of
						R3,900. That's about is what my family spends on junk food every month, so I decided to stop taking us
						to fast food for a month. Now we can be healthy, plus have the opportunity to get rich.</em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>The <a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a>
						system itself is a cryptocurrency auto-trading platform. The software uses advanced AI algorithms and
						machine learning to predict <strong>exactly</strong> when cryptocurrencies will go up and down. Then it
						will automatically buy and sell for you around the clock. Technology has already made our lives easier
						in every possible way, so why not use it to make more money as well?"</em></p>
					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">Zach's real time results with the
						system</b></a></h2>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>"Within 1 hour of depositing R3,900, the software started trading for me. To be
						honest, I was nervous it would lose all of my money. And sure enough, my first trade was a R300
						loss! </em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>I felt my throat close up. I thought I had been scammed. I was even ready to call my
						personal investor and ask for my money back. But then I remembered what my he told me earlier on our
						call: <strong>The algorithm is right about 80-89% of the time</strong>. You’re not going to win EVERY
						trade, but you'll win enough and be profitable overall. </em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>So I let the software keep trading for me and watched it closely. <strong>The next
						trade was profitable!</strong> Only R215 but it was still something. Then the next trade was <strong>R580
						profit.</strong> Then <strong>R250 profit</strong>, making a total profit of <strong>R760.</strong>
						And this was all under 5 minutes! </em></p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>Soon I started scooping up cash like ice-cream and I couldn’t believe my
						eyes. </em><em>Every time I refreshed the screen, my profits grew higher and higher. I felt like I was
						on drugs because this was such an exciting rush. </em></p>

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>Now I know why Raymond Ackerman is in a good mood all the time. And why the big banks don’t
						want people anywhere near this <a href="/click">wealth loophole</a>. By the end of the day, <strong>I

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>The next day was Tuesday and I had to go back to work. To be honest (and don’t tell my

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>I snuck out to the bathroom a few times to check my profits, and they kept stacking up
						(with a small loss here and there). At the end of the day, before I put my kids to sleep, my <strong>account

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>By the end of the week, I made a total of <strong>R60,694</strong> rands. I withdrew
						exactly R51,060 and re-invested the rest. Within 2 days I received my first cheque in the mail - for

					<p class="m-t-25"><i>"Now, I am consistently making an additional <strong>R7,950 to R17,020</strong> per

					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">how to get started with Immediate Edge
						(limited spots available)</b></a></h2>
					<p class="m-t-25">To get started, you only need your computer, smartphone, or tablet with internet access.
						You don't need any specific skills other than knowing how to use a computer and browsing the internet.
						You don’t need any technology or cryptocurrency experience because the software and your personal
						investor <a href="/click">guarantees you make a profit</a>. </p>
					<p class="m-t-25">Another perk of this program is you get to start when you want. You can make your own
						schedule - whether that's 5 hours a week or 50 hours a week. Just start the auto-trading software when
						you wish, and you can pause whenever you want (I don’t know why you ever would though). </p>
					<p class="m-t-25">To save our reader’s time and double check the Immediate Edge's functionality, Zachary
						kindly created a guide to getting started on the system.</p>
					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
							style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center">Here's My step-by-step walkthrough:</b></a>
					</h2>
					<p class="m-t-25">The first thing you see is a video showing off the power of <a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a>. The advertising is big and bold and in your face, but it is an American product and
						that's how they do things. Anyway, you <a href="/click">simply submit your name and email address</a>
						next to the video to get started right away. </p>
					<p class="m-t-25"><em>(<strong>Tip</strong>: Even if you don't decide to invest any money, I recommend <a
							href="/click">signing up now</a> because it's free and registrations for South Africa residents could
						end at any moment)</em></p>

					<a href="/click">
						<img src="images/step1__.png" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0px;"></a>
					<p class="m-t-25">Next up, you're asked to <a href="/click">fund your account</a>. As I was navigating the
						deposit page, my mobile rang. It was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but then I
						realised it was obviously from. </p>
					<a href="/click">
						<img src="images/bittrader-step2.png" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0px;"></a>
					<p class="m-t-25">Sure enough, it was my own personal account manager. His service was great. He took me
						through the entire funding process. They accept all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and
						American Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which is R3,900. </p>
					<a href="/click">
						<img src="images/bittrader-step3.png" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0px;"></a>
					<p class="m-t-25">Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of software, set the trade amount to
						the recommended R560 and enabled it. The software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was
						concerned at first but let it do its thing. </p>

					<p class="m-t-25"><em>"Everyone wants to be rich but no one knows how to do it. Well, <a href="/click">Immediate Edge</a> is the opportunity of a lifetime to build a fortune that will allow you to live the life
						you truly desire. It will NOT be around forever, so do not miss out."</em> - Raymond Ackerman<strong></strong></p>
					<h2><a href="/click" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><b
